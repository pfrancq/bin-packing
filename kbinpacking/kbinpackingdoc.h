/**	KBinPackingDoc provides a document object for a document-view model.
  *
  * The KBinPackingDoc class provides a document object that can be used in conjunction with the classes
  * KBinPackingApp and KBinPackingView to create a document-view model for MDI (Multiple Document Interface)
  * KDE 2 applications based on KApplication and KTMainWindow as main classes and QWorkspace as MDI manager widget.
  * Thereby, the document object is created by the KBinPackingApp instance (and kept in a document list) and contains
  * the document structure with the according methods for manipulating the document
  * data by KBinPackingView objects. Also, KBinPackingDoc contains the methods for serialization of the document data
  * from and to files.
